Everything here uses dbclient.py. dbclient reads .wellpapprc in ~, in all
parents to currentdir and finaly in currentdir. The last read version of an
option takes effect.

The following options should be specified:

server=hostname
port=number
image_base=path where you want symlinks to imported images
thumb_base=path where you want thumbnails of imported images
thumb_sizes=list of max dimensions for thumbnails

Example:

server=localhost
port=2225
image_base=/wellpapp/images
thumb_base=/wellpapp/thumbs
thumb_sizes=128 200

db_mktag.py:
Creates a tag. First argument is tag name, second (optional) argument is
tag type.

db_mkalias.py:
Creates an alias. First argument is tag name, second is alias name.

db_implies.py:
Creates an implication. First argument is set tag, second is implied tag,
and third is (optional) priority.

db_add.py:
Takes filenames. The filename "foo bar blutti.jpg" will recieve the tags
foo and bar (but not blutti), and all tags specified on the first line of
files named TAGS in all parent directories of the file.

db_add.py doesn't create tags, but complains if they don't exist.

db_tag.py:
Tag an (already imported) image. "db_add.py post-spec tag [tag [...]]" or
"db_add.py -r tag post-spec [post-spec [...]]".

db_show.py:
Show information about a post (md5/filename) or a tag (name).

db_rmpost.py:
Delete posts. Allows them to be referenced if you give -f.
"db_rmpost.py [-f] post-spec [post-spec [..]]"

db_order.py:
Order tags in a post. First argument is the tag, the following arguments are
post-specs that will be ordered as specified. It's not possible to order posts
in a tag that has weak or implied posts. If you specifiy only a single
post-spec this is ordered first.

db_mergetag.py:
Merges two tags into one. Takes two tag names as arguments, the second one
will be merged into the first, and all names for it will be recreated as
aliases for the first. Refuses if any posts have both tags at different
strengths, or if anything implies the second tag.

db_fsck.py:
Try to determine if your tag data, images and thumbnails are as they should
be. Run it without options for a bit more help. The -s option is only
useful if you suspect a server bug, and it's very slow on larger
collections.

db_findtag.py:
Find tags. -a for matching anywhere (not just at the start), -f for fuzzy.

db_tagwindow.py:
A graphical interface for tagging posts. Takes a list of post-specs as
arguments, and lets you tag the posts thus specified. Displays thumbnails
in the size specified first in thumb_sizes in your rc file.

Probably best launched either as "db_tagwindow.py *" in a directory with
images, or as an external editor from your image viewer of choice.

You can tab complete tags in the entry field, and drag and drop stuff in
the obvious ways where useful. (Dropping a tag on a thumbnail will tag only
that post, regardless of selection.)
