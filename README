Run as any fuse filesystem. Needs dbclient.py. Directories are searches.
Provides .thumblocal so viewers that use it don't have to generate
thumbnails.

You can separate search terms with spaces or as subdirs. Note that all
parent searches for directory separated searches are performed, which can
be slow.

You can also sort searches by specifying O:sort-spec (which becomes
Osort-spec when talking to the server). This prefixes image names with a
sequence number that your viewer can hopefully sort by.

Searches are cached for 30 seconds, to keep the slowness down a bit.
